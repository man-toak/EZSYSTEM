# EZSYSTEM

I develop this system to ease event organizer out there. This system will use the NFC tag and NFC reader during the event, 
to retrieve the attendance information, ease the organizer in monitoring the attendeesâ€™ and delivering the event resource 
to the attendees.

To deliver the resources to participant, I'm using SMTP which is configured in apache services.

Significance of this project :
- Increase the performance for conference organizers and participants.
- To make the reporting and documentation easy.
- Reduce resources (such as flyers and papers) and optimizes time during the attendance process.
